# THIS DIRECTORY IS NOT A DUMP OF LOGFILES

Here are some scripts used to attempt low level debugging of the SDK behavior (sequence of calls of
internal functions, effect of undocumented parameters, etc.), some documents about them,
and, as a baseline reference, **only the debug logs which may serve for comparison**.

Do not add verbose logs here 'just to provide an example'.
